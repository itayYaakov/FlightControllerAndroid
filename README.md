- In order two run our app correctly you will need to paste this setting into your flightGear simulator setting: --telnet=socket,in,10,127.0.0.1,6400,tcp , 6400 is just an option for the port number, choose any port avilable on your machine.
- After you applied the correct setting start the simulator.
